# Kmeans
The code in Kmeans_Scikit-learn_determine_hotspot will perform the Clustering on the images.
The functions in Find_best_cluster finds the pixel_temperature for every image and from that finds min,max and average for each Cluster.
From that it finds the maximum average of all the clusters and masks that cluster with (255,255,255).
The file Optimum-K finds the best number of clusters for a dataset which is currently in progress.
